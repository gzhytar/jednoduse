Before implementing: 
 - When uncertain about implementation (< 80% sure), ask clarifying questions. 
 - Search codebase for existing solutions before coding new ones. @admin-implementation.md @app-specification.md 
 - Check `specs/app-specification.md` for patterns and past decisions.
 - Prefer small, incremental fixes; document decision in `specs/app-specification.md` before changes touching > 5 files.

When implementing:
 - Split large tasks into small logical todo items and maintain the todo list in `todo.md`. 
 - Work on one todo item and one open PR at a time; think through ripple effects before edits. 

After implementing each ToDo item:
 - perform code cleanup: fix reported linter warning and errors.
 - mark implemented item in `todo.md` as `[done]` only after explicit confirmation; move to "Recently Completed" with date.

After completing the whole ToDo list:
 - update relevant documents in `specs` to reflect changes in business rules, use-cases, behaviors and important implementation notes
 - move future ideas to `specs/backlog.md` to keep todo focused on immediate work
